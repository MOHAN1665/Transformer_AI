How do I find out if my Aadhaar is already linked to multiple bank accounts?,"You can check Aadhaar linking status by logging into each of your bank's net banking portal or visiting the branch.

Can Aadhaar be used as a valid address proof if my address is outdated and I have applied for an update but it is still under review?,"No, if the Aadhaar address is outdated, it may not be accepted as valid proof by banks, government offices, or exam authorities. If you have already submitted an update request, you can download the 'Update Request Acknowledgement Slip' from the UIDAI portal.

Can I use Aadhaar eKYC for instant SIM card activation and how safe is it compared to physical verification?,"Yes, Aadhaar eKYC can be used for instant SIM card activation. Telecom operators provide biometric or OTP-based Aadhaar eKYC to verify customer identity instantly. It eliminates paperwork and reduces fraud risks since Aadhaar authentication is linked directly with UIDAI servers.

Once corrected, linking should work smoothly.",aadhaar_pan_linking,"Aadhaar, PAN, linking, spelling mistake, update, correction",
How can I update my Aadhaar address if I have recently moved but don’t have a rental agreement or utility bill in my name?,"If you do not have address proof in your name, UIDAI provides an ‘Address Validation Letter’ option. A resident who already has Aadhaar and lives at the same address (such as a family member or landlord) can help.

Some services may require you to manually re-verify Aadhaar after updates.",aadhaar_update,"Aadhaar, update, timeline, reflect, services",
I updated my Aadhaar mobile number but still receive OTPs on the old number. Why is this happening?,"This can happen due to delay in propagation of updated details. Usually, once your mobile number update is approved in UIDAI, the new number becomes active for OTP within a few hours to 2 days.
